struct-to-json
==============

Convert a go type to a JSON object.

Note: I'm not a dumbass, by convert, I mean the type description. (like describe the structure fields)

## Usage

```shell
Usage: struct-to-json <TypeName>
```

If you have a struct type Holodeck, you would use `struct-to-json Holodeck`.

Note: this is a work in progress. More of a prototype, really.
